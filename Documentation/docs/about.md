# About

## Introduction

The E-Fidget is a new kind of fidget spinner. It uses haptic feedback in the form of 3
vibration motors to simulate the feeling of spinning while not moving at all. This provides
several benefits, including being able to be "spun" from inside of a pocket to reduce distraction,
and much lower noise levels.

## Hardware overview

The E-Fidget is based around the ATtiny841 microcontroller, which is a low-cost and simple
AVR-based chip. It has 3 vibration motors with corresponding MOSFET drivers.

## Software overview

The recommended software for the E-Fidget is Arduino with [SpenceKonde's ATtinyCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore). Other platforms/IDEs/languages ***may or may not*** work!
