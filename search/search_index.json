It uses haptic feedback in the form of 8 vibration motors to simulate the feeling of spinning while not moving at all. This provides several benefits, including being able to be \"spun\" from inside of a pocket to reduce distraction, and much lower noise levels.</p>"},{"location":"about/#hardware-overview","title":"Hardware overview","text":"<p>The E-Fidget is based around the RP2040 microcontroller, the same one found inside the popular Raspberry Pi Pico! It has 16 MBits of on-board flash storage, and 8 vibration motors with corresponding MOSFET drivers.</p>"},{"location":"about/#software-overview","title":"Software overview","text":"<p>The recommended software for the E-Fidget is CircuitPython, the easy-to-use Python port for microcontrollers. While you're free to try other languages, I won't be able to support you with them as readily! (I'll still try, of course)</p>"}]}
